# CPP Test

CPP Test is a minimal unit testing framework.

## Example

You can find an example in the root directory: "test.cpp". You just have to
define your test case and run it with one of the test runners. At the moment
there are 2 different test runners:

 * QtTestRunner
 * TextTestRunner

To compile the example you can use CMake or write your own make file. I cannot
guarantee that everything works on Windows or Mac. I just tested with Linux and
gcc.
